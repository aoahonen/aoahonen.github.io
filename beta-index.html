     <h4>Estre</h4>
     <p>Estee is "on a journey to becoming a healthier version of me." Last year, when a trainer recommended food journaling, she thought "there’s no way." But the idea of snapping photos instead of putting pen to paper was more palatable. Now she uses MealLogger eight or nine times a day. "It's become a habit," she says — one that has helped her drop over 40 pounds.</p>

     <h4>Monty</h4>
     <p>Last November, Monty started a public group called "Making Eating a Lifestyle Change, Not a Diet." While he’s especially interested in bringing others who have had weight loss surgery into the group — which now has 16 members — anyone who is "willing to change their eating habits to achieve a new lifestyle" is welcome. And when it comes to personal change, Monty is proof that it's possible.</p>

     <h4>Traci</h4>
     <p>Traci has been food journaling for a dozen years and is delighted to have found a simpler way with MealLogger. A former Weight Watcher, she finds that "snapping a pic and texting a short note makes things a lot easier." Over the years, the habit of food journaling has helped her to lose 60 pounds. She started using MealLogger last November, and found she was able to maintain her weight through the winter — when she typically gains 15-20 pounds — without much fuss.</p>

     <h4>Tina</h4>
     <p>Tina decided a year ago to take charge of her own health with the help of a personal trainer and registered dietitian. "The little changes my registered dietitian suggested — like adding almonds to my mid-afternoon snack of yogurt and fruit — really paid off. He points things out I'd never thought of before. It’s been a real education." And by using MealLogger, both she and her registered dietitian were able to keep track of her eating patterns more easily. "This awesome tool has allowed me to become healthy!"</p>

      <p>My money's in that office, right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there, and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen: we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there, you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand? </p>

      <h4>Are you ready for the truth?</h4>
      <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee. </p>
